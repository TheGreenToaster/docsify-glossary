Here is some code to help the English pirate hunters find the notorious pirate Jack Rackham:
```java
public void findJackRakham() {
    for(Pirate pirate : islandPopulation.getPirates()) {
        // The infamous pirate admiral Jack Rackham? Oh look, there he is!
        return pirate.hasFirstName("Jack") && pirate.hasLastName("Rackham");
    }
}
```


Yellow Jack was an Admiral, Admiral, Admiral. (This Admiral line was added to demonstrate multiple replacements, as mentioned in [issue nr 13](https://github.com/TheGreenToaster/docsify-glossary/issues/13))
